# Tiny Stream Player

Just a small player that can play video streams. I need to watch for my dog in living room while working 
and couldn't find anything small and with simple features such as pan and zoom.

## Features
- Opening multiple streams (RTSP, RTMP, HSL and everything else [media_kit](https://github.com/media-kit/media-kit) supports)
- Zoom and pan streams
- Mute/pause/reload streams
- Saving streams to automatically load them on app startup

This app is intended to show live streams hence there's no trackbar. Also, it's supposed to be 
very simple - it should load stream and open it on app startup automatically, so I can just open it and
have stream loaded out-of-box. I've also treated it a little as my Flutter sandbox.
